## Testing

All testing for the CASTanet tool is done using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), a framework which
allows developers to write test cases for the Python programming language. For information on `pytest` please visit their
[documentation.](https://docspytest.org/en/stable/)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to CASTanet](https://github.com/Allegheny-Mozilla-Fellows/misinformation) with a clear list of
what you've done. Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). Please follow this
customized [template](https://github.com/cmpsc-481-s22-m1/CASTanet/blob/documentation/.github/pull_request_template.md) when creating
a pull request for CASTanet.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like
this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Vigor will
generally not be accepted.

## Do you want to contribute to CASTanet's documentation?

You can help improve the CASTanet guides by making them more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information,
correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date with the latest  information.

To do so, make changes to CASTanet's source files (located here on GitHub) or comments in source code. Then open a pull request to
apply your changes to the master branch.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Please email Madelyn Kapfhammer for any and all questions related to the CASTanet tool.
